# day-scheduler

- Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a simple and effective way to manage a work day schedule.

- Why This Was Built

This was built to provide a user-friendly interface for scheduling tasks throughout a work day.

- What It Solved

This project solved the problem of managing and keeping track of tasks in a day. It provides a clear visual representation of the day's schedule, making it easy to see what tasks are coming up and what has been completed.

- What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to effectively use jQuery to manipulate the DOM, how to use local storage to persist data, and how to use third-party libraries like dayjs to manage time.
